# Grocery Splitter

A spring-boot web application that serves the purpose of splitting a receipt between a group of people. Targeted at college students and first-time apartment renters. Our application will eliminate the need to do manual receipt calculations in order to save time and increase splitting accuracy. Unlike Venmoâ€™s bill splitting feature, our application will be able to split the receipt by each individual grocery item.

## Usage

```bash
# Start a docker container running postgres on port 5432
docker run --name grocery-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=grocery -d -p 5432:5432 postgres:alpine
docker start grocery-postgres
docker ps
docker exec -it [container-id] bin/bash

# In container
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE grocerydb;

# Outside of container
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
